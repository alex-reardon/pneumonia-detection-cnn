Chest X-ray Pneumonia Detection with Deep Learning

# Pneumonia Detection with CNN 🩺🔍  

This project implements a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to detect pneumonia in chest X-ray images using the **Chest X-ray dataset** from Kaggle.  

## 🛠️ What You'll Learn  
✅ Deep learning with CNNs (Convolutional Neural Networks)  
✅ Transfer learning with PyTorch (or TensorFlow/Keras)  
✅ Handling medical imaging datasets  
✅ Model evaluation for healthcare AI  

## 📂 Dataset  
The dataset can be downloaded from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/paultimothymooney/chest-xray-pneumonia).  

## 🚀 Getting Started  
1. Clone this repository:  
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/pneumonia-detection-cnn.git
   cd pneumonia-detection-cnn
2. Install Dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt

3. Run the Training Script
python train.py


📊 Results
After training, the model's accuracy and loss will be visualized using Matplotlib. You can evaluate its performance on test images.
